ReadMe- Part-1

The first part was to make the google and weather api work to produce a result without having to save data. 
For this part I used php and js to code in. I also downloaded WAMP a software to run php files. 
I am using the weather api to show a table for weather data and used a directions api to get the directions and 
waypoints for the route. Just run index.php on localhost and you should be able to run the project.
